# DMS-Category-Codes

A DMS script that helps you check data for ghost categories.

Just add MDD & DDF file name at the top. As it's a DMS script, it needs output data source to write to. Just specify a random name (Rtestout.mdd by default), but you'll have to delete these files when processing finishes.

The output is saved in a text file <code>report.categorymap.log.txt</code>
